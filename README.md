# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A look at how astroturf can be used as an option for css in js. 

The POC demonstrates the basic uses and approaches which can be implemented using astroturf library with existing SCSS code.

It also looks at the theming aspect and of organising variables in a centralised SCSS style location.
